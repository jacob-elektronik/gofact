0.     INTRODUCTION

       This specification provides the definition of the Delivery just
       in time message (DELJIT) to be used in Electronic Data
       Interchange (EDI) between trading partners involved in
       administration, commerce and transport.

1.     SCOPE

1.1    Functional definition

       A message provides the ability for a customer to convey precise
       delivery sequence and Just In Time schedule requirements to a
       supplier, and is intended to supplement the Delivery Schedule
       Message (DELFOR).

1.2    Field of application

       The Delivery just in time message may be used for both national
       and international applications. It is based on universal
       practice related to administration, commerce and transport, and
       is not dependent on the type of business or industry.

1.3    Principles

       The use of this message will facilitate the practice of Just In
       Time (JIT) delivery by providing the customer with a mechanism
       to issue precise shipping schedule requirements in terms of a
       24 hour clock and on a more frequent basis than with the
       instance of a delivery schedule message, e.g. daily shipping
       schedules versus weekly planning schedules.

3.     TERMS AND DEFINITIONS

3.1    Standard terms and definitions

       See UNTDID, Part 4, Chapter 2.3 UN/ECE UNSM - General
       Introduction, Section 2.

4.     MESSAGE DEFINITION

4.1    Segment clarification

       This section should be read in conjunction with the segment
       table which indicates mandatory, conditional and repeating
       requirements.
       
       The following guidelines and principles apply to the whole
       message and are intended to facilitate the understanding and
       implementation of the message: 
       
       All specified dates/times should be in the format
       'ccyymmdd'/'hhmm' unless all parties involved in the
       transaction agree that there is a functional requirement for an
       alternative format. Periods should be specified as whole
       numbers representing the required period as indicated in the
       format qualifier (weeks, months, etc.) 
       
       Where a choice of code or text is given only the code element
       should be used wherever possible.
       
       Conditional data that is not required in the message should not
       be included.
       
       Care must be taken that the segment qualifier in dependent
       segments do not conflict with the segment qualifier of the
       trigger segment of a group.
       
       Free text information within the message should be avoided as
       this inhibits automatic processing.
